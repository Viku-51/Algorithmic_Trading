# Algorithmic_Trading
The world is now at a zone where retail traders are overpowered by the use of High frequency traders or traders working with algorithms to increase there profits. Having an experience of about 2 years in Trading, I have always fascinated by the concept of algorithmic trading. Thus gave a try on algo-trading. Algorithms have gained popularity in the trading landscape and many big clients demand it. These mathematical algorithms analyse every quote and trade in the stock market, identify liquidity opportunities, and turn the information into intelligent trading decisions. Algorithmic trading, or computer-directed trading, cuts down transaction costs, and allows investment managers to take control of their own trading processes. Algorithm innovation continues to offer returns for firms with the scale to absorb the costs and to reap the benefits.
